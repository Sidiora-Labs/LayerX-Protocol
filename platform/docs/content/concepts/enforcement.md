# Who enforces what

Most payment platforms describe every restriction in the same voice, so a customer cannot tell which ones survive an attacker owning the vendor's servers. LayerX labels each capability with the layer that actually holds it, and this documentation fails its own build if a page documents capabilities without stating them.

## The four layers

| Layer | Who enforces it | What survives |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | The LayerX state machine | Everything above it, including a hostile client, a hostile daemon and a hostile gateway |
| `agent-layer` | `layerx-agentd` while it is in the request path | Nothing that bypasses the daemon |
| `service` | A LayerX service process, or middleware you deploy | Callers of that service only |
| `hosted-surface` | The hosted gateway, faucet or dashboard | Traffic arriving through the hosted deployment |

**A lower layer never implies a higher one.** A restriction the daemon enforces is not a protocol guarantee, and describing it as one is the failure mode this labelling exists to prevent.

## How to read a label

Ask what an attacker would have to compromise to defeat the capability.

- A `protocol` capability requires breaking the transition function itself. Your budget ceiling is here, which is why an agent that is fully compromised still cannot spend past what you funded.
- An `agent-layer` capability requires getting to the protocol without going through `layerx-agentd`. Capability attenuation is here.
- A `service` capability requires reaching around the service. Quote-then-commit is here; so is the receipt gate in your own seller middleware, which binds requests arriving through your middleware and nothing else.
- A `hosted-surface` capability requires nothing but a different deployment. Rate limits and API key policy are here.

None of these are worthless. They are just worth different amounts, and you should know which you are buying.

## Where this shows up

Every page on this site ends with an "Enforced by" table. The [enforcement reference](reference-enforcement.html) collects every capability the documentation states, grouped by layer, and is generated from the same registry the build validates.

The same rule governs the release qualification report: every guarantee in it is stated as protocol-enforced, agent-layer-enforced, service-enforced or hosted-surface-enforced, and a release with an unmet gate is refusable by tooling rather than by reviewer discipline.

## The same honesty when something breaks

Layer labelling is only half of it. When a component is degraded, saying so vaguely destroys the same information the labels exist to preserve: a single red indicator tells you something is wrong and hides whose problem it is.

The status page therefore reports the gateway, the testnet, the core and the Paxeer settlement side separately. A degraded gateway with a healthy core means your queued payments are still going to settle; a degraded core means something quite different. Collapsing the two into one dot would be tidier and would tell you less.

## Enforced by

| Capability | Layer | What that means here |
|---|---|---|
| Atomic settlement | `protocol` | The canonical example: no component above the protocol can produce a half-applied payment. |
| Capability attenuation | `agent-layer` | Real, useful, and defeated by anything that reaches the protocol without the daemon. |
| Receipt-gated resource release | `service` | Binds requests that reach your service through the middleware. |
| Hosted rate limits | `hosted-surface` | An operational control on the hosted deployment, not a property of the protocol. |
| Honest degradation reporting | `hosted-surface` | Each component's health is reported on its own, so an outage names whose it is. |
