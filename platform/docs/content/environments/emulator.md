# The emulator

The emulator is the local LayerX environment. It is not a mock: it runs the real protocol core transition, produces real receipts, and refuses everything the real chain refuses. What it adds is control - you can set the clock, prefund an account, inject a fault, and snapshot the whole world.

## Starting it

```
layerx emulator up --listen 127.0.0.1:9402
```

Defaults: listen on `127.0.0.1:9402`, network id `402`, clock at `1700000000000` milliseconds. Override any of them:

```
layerx emulator up \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:9402 \
  --network-id 402 \
  --time-ms 1700000000000 \
  --prefund did:layerx:alice,<64-hex-public-key>,1000000
```

`--prefund` may be repeated. Its format is `did,64-hex-public-key,amount`, where the amount is either a plain integer or `high:low` for values beyond 64 bits.

Point your app at it and nothing else changes:

```
export LAYERX_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9402
layerx environment use local --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9402 --network-id 402
```

Loopback `http://` is accepted here and only here. Every non-loopback endpoint must be `https://`, in the CLI and in the middleware transport alike, and that is a refusal rather than a warning.

## The protocol surface

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | Readiness |
| `POST /v1/activities` | Submit a canonical activity, receive a receipt |
| `GET /v1/state` | State root, next sequence, batch number, clock, cell and account counts |
| `GET /v1/receipts/{id}` | Exact receipt material |

These are the real endpoints. Receipts fetched here verify with `layerx receipt verify` exactly as production receipts do, against the batch facts the emulator reports.

## The control surface

Everything under `/__emulator` exists only here. It is what makes tests deterministic instead of flaky.

| Method and path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /__emulator/accounts/prefund` | Fund an account without a faucet |
| `POST /__emulator/time/set` | Set the clock to an exact millisecond |
| `POST /__emulator/time/advance` | Move the clock forward by a delta |
| `POST /__emulator/faults` | Inject a fault |
| `GET /__emulator/snapshot` | Export the whole state |
| `PUT /__emulator/snapshot` | Import a previously exported state |

Fault kinds are `reject`, `drop_receipt` and `corrupt_receipt`, each with an optional `count` (default 1).

Those three are the ones worth building tests around, because they are the failure modes that separate correct integrations from lucky ones:

- **`reject`** - the activity is refused. Does your code release the budget reservation, or does it leak?
- **`drop_receipt`** - the activity may have applied, but no receipt comes back. This is the `unknown` outcome, and the correct behaviour is to leave it unknown and resolve it by receipt lookup under the idempotency key. Code that retries here double-pays in production.
- **`corrupt_receipt`** - a receipt arrives and does not verify. `verification-failure`, not success.

Snapshot export and import make a scenario reproducible: set up the world once, export it, and import it at the start of every test.

## Advancing time

Timeouts, expiries and settlement windows are real, and waiting for them in wall-clock time makes a test suite slow and non-deterministic. Set the clock, submit, advance the clock past the window, and assert. The core sees exactly the timestamp you set.

## What the emulator is not

It is a single local process holding state in memory. It is not a network, so it has no consensus, no other validators, and no external anchoring - `settlement-anchored` is not something a local run establishes. Differential conformance against the hosted testnet is what closes that gap, and it is a separate exercise from local development.

For an environment with real finality and other participants, use the [testnet](environments-testnet.html).

## Enforced by

| Capability | Layer | What that means here |
|---|---|---|
| Atomic settlement | `protocol` | The emulator runs the real core transition; a rejected activity leaves no partial state. |
| Conserved supply | `protocol` | Prefunding creates balance explicitly; nothing else does. |
| Offline receipt verification | `protocol` | Emulator receipts verify by the same pure function as production receipts. |
| Replay refusal | `protocol` | Resubmitting a canonical activity is refused here as it is in production. |
| Unknown is a real outcome | `agent-layer` | `drop_receipt` produces a genuine unknown, so you can test that you keep it unknown. |
| Testnet faucet funding | `hosted-surface` | Not present locally - `--prefund` and the prefund endpoint replace it. |
