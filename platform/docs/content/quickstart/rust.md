# Rust quickstart

Rust is where LayerX is implemented, so the Rust surface is aimed at the two things Rust callers actually want: talking to the protocol directly through `layerx-client`, and verifying evidence with no service in the path.

> `layerx-sdk` ships the agent-plane client, the typed error taxonomy, the receipt and mirror verifiers, and typed human-plane call construction through `HumanApiCalls`. It does not yet ship an HTTP client for the human plane. Until it does, make the payment with the `layerx` CLI - which is a real Rust client over the same endpoint - and do the part that matters in your own process: verify the receipt.

## Make the payment

```text
layerx payment test --from "$LAYERX_SOURCE" --to "$LAYERX_DESTINATION" \
  --currency "$LAYERX_CURRENCY" --amount "$LAYERX_AMOUNT" \
  --idempotency-key order-2f9c1b7e4a10 --json
```

That quotes and commits under a key you chose and prints the journey. Fetch the receipt material it references:

```text
layerx receipt get "$EVIDENCE_ID" --json
```

## Verify it yourself

```text
cargo add layerx-sdk layerx-proof
```

```rust sample=verify-receipt-rust
use layerx_proof::receipt::AuthorizedBatch;
use layerx_sdk::production::verify_receipt;

fn settlement(receipt: &[u8], batch: &BatchFacts) -> Result<Settlement, String> {
    let authorised = AuthorizedBatch::new(batch.batch_id, batch.asset, batch.previous_state_root, batch.resulting_state_root, batch.sequencer_public_key);
    let verified = verify_receipt(receipt, &authorised).map_err(|failure| format!("receipt refused at {:?}", failure.check))?;
    let facts = verified.receipt().protocol().ok_or("receipt carries no protocol facts")?;
    Ok(Settlement { level: verified.level().wire_rank(), amount: facts.amount(), result_code: facts.result_code(), digest: verified.evidence().receipt_digest().ok_or("verifier produced no digest")? })
}
```

`AuthorizedBatch::new` takes the five 32-byte facts that identify the batch you are checking against: the batch identifier, the asset, the previous and resulting state roots, and the sequencer public key. `verify_receipt` returns the exact check that failed - canonical encoding, invariant, root chain or signature - rather than a generic error, and on success gives you the verification level, the protocol facts and the receipt digest.

Get those five facts from a source you trust. Taking them from the same service that gave you the receipt proves nothing; that is the entire point of verifying locally.

## Run the whole sample

```text
cd platform/docs/samples/verify-receipt-rust
cargo build --release
LAYERX_RECEIPT_FILE=./receipt.hex \
LAYERX_BATCH_ID=$(cat ./batch/batch-id.hex) \
LAYERX_BATCH_ASSET=$(cat ./batch/asset.hex) \
LAYERX_PREVIOUS_STATE_ROOT=$(cat ./batch/previous-state-root.hex) \
LAYERX_RESULTING_STATE_ROOT=$(cat ./batch/resulting-state-root.hex) \
LAYERX_SEQUENCER_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat ./batch/sequencer-public-key.hex) \
cargo run --release
```

The batch facts are read from files here for a reason: they must come from somewhere you trust independently of whoever handed you the receipt. The receipt file itself may be raw canonical bytes or the hex text the CLI prints; the sample accepts either. It has no dependency beyond `layerx-proof` and `layerx-sdk`, and it is its own cargo workspace, so it does not join the platform workspace when you copy it.

## Verifying without any LayerX component

`verify_mirror_receipt` checks a receipt out of an untrusted mirror archive: it validates the archive, checks the batch header against trust you configure, proves inclusion, and returns freshness alongside the result instead of implying it. That path needs no node, no gateway and no hosted service.

## Enforced by

| Capability | Layer | What that means here |
|---|---|---|
| Offline receipt verification | `protocol` | This program is the proof: receipt bytes plus batch facts, and nothing else. |
| Atomic settlement | `protocol` | The receipt describes a state change that either happened whole or not at all. |
| Conserved supply | `protocol` | A receipt describing a balance change outside a 402LXP transfer would not verify. |
| Honest verification levels | `agent-layer` | The level returned is the one the evidence justifies, never a requested one that was not achieved. |
