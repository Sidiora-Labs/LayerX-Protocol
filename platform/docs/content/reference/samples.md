# Sample index

Every code block in this documentation is extracted from one of these directories. The site build re-extracts each block from its source file and fails when a page and its sample disagree, so a stale sample cannot survive a build.

| Sample | Language | Directory | Run it | Integration lines |

## What each sample needs

| Sample | Requires |
|---|---|
| First payment in C# | .NET 8 or newer, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment in Go | Go 1.21 or newer, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment in Java | JDK 21 and Maven, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment in Python | Python 3.11 or newer, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment in Swift | Swift 5.9 or newer, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment in TypeScript | Node.js 22 or newer, plus LAYERX_API_URL, LAYERX_API_TOKEN, LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY in the environment. |
| First payment on Android | JDK 21 and Maven, the same publishable configuration as the iOS sample, and the move inputs LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY. The app holds no long-lived credential. |
| First payment on iOS | Swift 5.9 or newer, LAYERX_SERVICE_URL and LAYERX_SESSION_BROKER_URL, at least one LAYERX_EVENT_PUBLIC_KEY_<key-id>, and the move inputs LAYERX_SOURCE, LAYERX_DESTINATION, LAYERX_AMOUNT, LAYERX_CURRENCY and LAYERX_PAYMENT_KEY. The app holds no long-lived credential. |
| Paid endpoint on Express | Node.js 22 or newer and the twenty declared seller keys the integration reads from the environment: LAYERX_PRINCIPAL, LAYERX_PROTECTED_PATH, the LAYERX_RESOURCE_* fields, LAYERX_X402_SCHEME, LAYERX_X402_NETWORK, LAYERX_PRICE, LAYERX_ASSET, LAYERX_PAY_TO, LAYERX_PAYMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, LAYERX_AUTHORIZED_BATCH_JSON, LAYERX_WEBHOOK_PATH, LAYERX_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEYS_JSON, LAYERX_WEBHOOK_MAX_AGE_MS and LAYERX_WEBHOOK_LEASE_MS. |
| Paid endpoint on FastAPI | Python 3.11 or newer, uvicorn, and the same twenty declared seller keys as the Express sample. |
| Paid endpoint on Spring Boot | JDK 21 and Maven. The bundled application.yaml binds the layerx.* properties from LAYERX_PRINCIPAL, LAYERX_PROTECTED_PATH, the LAYERX_RESOURCE_* fields, the payment fields, the five LAYERX_*_STATE_ROOT and batch facts, and the webhook key material. |
| Paid route on Next.js | Node.js 22 or newer and the same declared seller keys as the Express sample. LAYERX_TOKEN is the one declared secret; the bundle scanner fails a build whose client bundle carries it or any NEXT_PUBLIC_ variable holding the same value. |
| Independent receipt verification in Rust | A Rust toolchain, a receipt file named by LAYERX_RECEIPT_FILE, and the batch facts LAYERX_BATCH_ID, LAYERX_BATCH_ASSET, LAYERX_PREVIOUS_STATE_ROOT, LAYERX_RESULTING_STATE_ROOT and LAYERX_SEQUENCER_PUBLIC_KEY as 32-byte hex. |
